# RobotMeshCheese

Sneaky lil function to auto complete a robot-mesh course

Idk if teachers can see the code you submitted but if they can, use it carefuly cuz it don't write no code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


# How to use

1. Open your browser's dev tools console
2. Copy and paste the whole thing (You can use a JS injector to automate this process)
3. Type "complete()" into the console
4. Reload the page to confirm that it actually worked
